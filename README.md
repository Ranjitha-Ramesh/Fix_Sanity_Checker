"# Fix_Sanity_Checker" 

This project, downloads the fixes from Repo specified in the properties file and compares two specified files using winMerge OpenSource tool. 
In order to effectively compare two fixes of different version, this project also renames the fix numbers of extracted zip files under replicate/inbound to enable comparision.
A simple UI automation is in place using opensource tool AHK(AutoHotKeys) to click few buttons on the winMerge UI to generate Report and save it in HTML format.
